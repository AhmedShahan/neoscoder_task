            "description": "Ferrous sulfate can reduce the absorption of levothyroxine.  Taking them together may require adjusting the levothyroxine dose to maintain therapeutic levels.  The interaction is more significant if taken simultaneously.",
            "recommendation": "Administer ferrous sulfate and levothyroxine at least 4 hours apart. Monitor TSH levels closely to ensure adequate thyroid hormone replacement. Consider alternative iron formulations with better bioavailability if absorption issues persist."
